## Installation & Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/suryanarayanrenjith/SHMatrix.git
   cd SHMatrix
   ```

2. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x Matrix.sh
   ```
   Alternatively, if this does not work for some reason, you can use:
   ```bash
   chmod 777 Matrix.sh
   ```

3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   ./Matrix.sh
   ```

## Customization

- `SPEED`: Adjust the animation speed (default: `0.1`). Lower values make it faster.
- `CHARSET`: Customize the characters used in the rain effect (default: `01`).

## Disclaimer

SHMatrix is a lightweight and fun script, but it's not optimized. For a more polished and professional Matrix effect, consider using [cmatrix](https://github.com/abishekvashok/cmatrix).
